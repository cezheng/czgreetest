This is the very first test app for GREE Platform's sandbox, running on Google Application Engine, doing very simple stuff, that is recording the GREE Platform's life-cycle events. 

It is just a practice for creating an web app on the GREE Platform and using the platform's People API.

Also, writen in python, with some polishment, this can server as a "Getting Started" example for Python developper who wish to develop apps on GREE, as well as putting a GREE app on Google Application Engine.
